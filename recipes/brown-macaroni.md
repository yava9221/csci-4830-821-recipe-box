# Brown Macaroni

## Ingredients

*   2 tbsp vegetable oil or olive oil
*   1 16 oz bag of elbow pasta
*   2 15 oz cans tomato sauce
*   Water as measured by tomato cans
*   Pepper to taste
*   Garlic salt to taste

## Preparation

Place oil and entire bag of elbow pasta in a large skillet or fry pan on medium to high heat.
Stir constantly until pasta is light to medium brown. It will turn white, then golden, then
different shades of brown much like making a rue. Once at the desired color, take off the heat
and drain the excess oil. It may be easiest to do so by slightly tipping the pan and pushing
the pasta to the top and letting the oil pool at the bottom tilted part of the pan and then
carefully spooning the oil out into a container that is safe to hold hot oil. It is not 
necessary to drain all of the oil but as much as possible. Once this is done, place one can
of tomato sauce in the pan carefully as the oil will sizzle and then carefully stir. Fill 
tomato can with water to the top of the can and put in pan. Continue adding water this way 
until pasta is covered by liquid mixture. Keep on medium high heat for approximately ten to 
fifteen minutes stirring occasionally. When liquid mixture no longer covers pasta, add the other
can of tomato sauce and then water as necessary until pasta is tender and no longer sticks to 
teeth. Note that the pasta will not be as tender as if just boiling without frying. Add garlic 
salt and pepper to taste and boil down until pasta to sauce ratio is higher (not soupy). Can 
serve immediately but will be incredibly hot so you may wish to add a couple of ice cubes and 
mix until desired temperature or just wait for meal to cool.
